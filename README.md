https://eravazzolo.github.io/Rick-Veronese/

## Description
This project is the portfolio website of UX/UI Designer Rick Veronese, which was originally built on Wordpress.

## Goals
- Build whole website with the use of CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox 
- Use of media queries for different screen widths for improved responsiveness
- Use of Javascript to style the header on scroll
- Use a plugin to visualise images 

## Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3: SASS, Flexbox, CSS Grid Layout
- JAVASCRIPT
- Lightbox plugin
- NPM

## Outcome
I am very pleased with my first independent project, using all the features and tools I had set out to use.

After doing a simple load speed test of my code against the Wordpress version of the website, I was pleased to see that my code had improved not only the load time, but also the overall size and number of requests made.

This project taught me how to research and skimmed through information sources. Most importantly, I learned how to structure my own workflow through trial and error, giving myself time to experiment with different strategies.
